# New and curious

I come from a marketing background and have experience in CMS systems (Typo3, Wordpress etc.) and have also helped with a shop go live via Shopware 6.

Creating something has always fascinated me, which is why I decided to join the bootcamp at neuefische. 

My hobbies reflect this passion:

- 🎨 Painting - acrylic on canvas
- 👩‍🍳 Cooking and baking for friends
- 💃 Dancing - especially to house music

This could look like this ;):
