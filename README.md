# All about Pia LÃ¼ling and her life before the Web Development Bootcamp

I come from a marketing background and have experience in CMS systems (Typo3, Wordpress etc.) and have also helped with a shop go live via Shopware 6.
Creating something has always fascinated me, which is why I decided to join the bootcamp at neuefische. 

My hobbies reflect this passion:

- Painting - acrylic on canvas
- Cooking and baking for friends
- Dancing - especially to house music
